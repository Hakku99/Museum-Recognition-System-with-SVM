#### Why are we converting images into numpy array before training?

> Machine Learning Models Work with Numbers

Images are essentially grids of pixel values. Each pixel has:
    - For grayscale: a single number (0â€“255)
    - For color: three numbers (RGB channels)

So we convert images into NumPy arrays to represent these pixel values numerically in a format models can understand.
